This iOS application was developed during Hack The North 2016 with a group of three people. This app uses location based services to compare Apple product prices between USA and Canada. The price is calculated using real-time currency conversion and involves taxes and gas price to compare and find the cheapest option. The application uses REST APIs from XE Currency exchange and Google Geocoding for location.
